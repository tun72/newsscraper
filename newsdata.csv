Coca-Cola to pay $6 billion in IRS back taxes case while appealing judge's decision,Coca-Cola Co. says it will pay $6 billion in back taxes and interest to the Internal Revenue Service while it appeals a federal tax court decision in a case dating back 17 years,KEN RITTER Associated Press,"Coca-Cola Co. said Friday it will pay $6 billion in back taxes and interest to the Internal Revenue Service while it appeals a final federal tax court decision in a case dating back 17 years. The  “The company looks forward to the opportunity to begin the appellate process and, as part of that process, will pay the agreed-upon liability and interest,” it said in a statement. Coca-Cola spokesperson Scott Leith declined additional comment to The Associated Press. U.S. Tax Court Judge Albert Lauber on Friday issued a two-sentence decision and order ending his look at the case. The dispute reached court in December 2015, shortly after the company said it notified the IRS that  In its Friday statement, Coca-Cola accused the IRS of changing how it let the company calculate U.S. income based on profits amounting to more than $9 billion from foreign licensees and affiliates. An IRS spokesperson did not immediately respond Friday to a telephone message from AP about the case.

Warren Buffett surprises by slashing Berkshire Hathaway's longtime Apple stake in second quarter,Investor Warren Buffett slashed Berkshire Hathaway's massive Apple stake that he once called a pillar of the company that he intended to hold indefinitely,JOSH FUNK AP business writer,"OMAHA, Neb. --  Selling off a big chunk of its Apple holdings was the quarter's biggest news — Buffett once called the company's stake in the iPhone maker a pillar of Berkshire’s business that he intended to hold indefinitely. The other major investment moves Buffett made during the quarter included continued cuts to its investment in Chinese EV maker BYD and selling off some of its Bank of America stock. Berkshire didn't give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday's report, but it estimated the investment was worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $237.23. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire's Apple stake was worth $135.4 billion. Berkshire said it earned $30.348 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That's down from $35.912 billion, or $24,775 per A share, a year ago when the paper value of its investment portfolio was up $24.2 billion.  This year the value of the investments Berkshire continues to hold fell $28.2 billion. Buffett has long cautioned investors that it's better to look at Berkshire's operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter.  By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew more than 15% to $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, from $10.043 billion, or $6,928.40 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire's businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results. The results easily topped the $6,530.25 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted. Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.

Arizona governor negotiates pause in hauling of uranium ore across Navajo Nation,Arizona's governor says a uranium producer has agreed to temporarily pause transport of the mineral through the Navajo Nation after the tribe raised concerns related to a safety plan,The Associated Press,"PHOENIX --  Gov. Katie Hobbs said Friday that she intervened this week after talking with Navajo President Buu Nygren, who had come up with a plan to test a tribal law that bans uranium from being transported on its land. Energy Fuels began hauling the ore Tuesday from its mine south of Grand Canyon National Park to a processing site in Blanding, Utah. When Nygren found out, he ordered tribal police to pull over the trucks and prevent them from traveling further. But by the time police arrived, the semi-trucks had left the reservation. Energy Fuels said in a statement Friday that it agreed to a temporary pause “to address any reasonable concerns” held by Nygren. It recently started  “While Energy Fuels can legally restart transport at any time, pursuant to the current licenses, permits, and federal law, the company understands and respects President Nygren’s concern for his People, and wants to assure them that the company fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations,” the company said. “The U.S. has adopted the highest international standards for the transport of such materials, which are in place to protect human health and the environment.” Energy Fuels isn't legally required to give advance notice. But the Navajo Nation, the U.S. Forest Service, county officials and others says the company verbally agreed to do so — and then reneged on the promise Tuesday.  The Navajo Nation said it wanted to ensure it had time to coordinate emergency preparedness plans and other notifications before hauling began. Energy Fuels said it notified federal, state county and tribal officials about two weeks ago that hauling was imminent and outlined legal requirements, safety and emergency response.  The tribe said it didn't expect hauling to begin for at least another month, based on months of conversations with Energy Fuels. Hobbs said the pause on transporting the ore will allow the company and the tribe “to engage in good faith negotiations.” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes also said her office is looking into legal options “to protect the health and safety of all Arizonans.” The tribe passed a law in 2012 to ban the transportation of uranium on the reservation that extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. But the law exempts state and federal highways that Energy Fuels has designated as hauling routes. Mining during World War II and the Cold War left  "
Amazon reports boost in quarterly profits but misses revenue estimates,"Amazon has reported a boost in its quarterly profits, but the company missed revenue estimates, sending its stock lower in after-hours trading",HALELUYA HADERO AP business writer,"Amazon The  Earnings per share for the second quarter came out to $1.26, higher than analysts' expectations of $1.03.  However, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading Amazon shares to fall more than 6% after the closing bell. The company posted revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase that fell slightly below analyst expectations of $148.67 billion.  Amazon also said it expects revenue for the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30, to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion — lower than the $158.22 billion forecast by analysts.  Amazon boosted its spending during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep up with higher demand from consumers who became more reliant on online shopping. But as demand cooled and wider economic conditions pressured other parts of its business, the company aggressively cut costs by eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees.  The cost-cutting has led to growth in profits. However, Amazon is also feeling the benefits of the buzz around generative artificial intelligence, which has helped reaccelerate its  The company said Thursday that Amazon Web Services saw a 19% jump in revenue compared to the same period last year.  “We’re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,” Amazon  The cloud computing unit, whose customers are mostly businesses, has been attempting to lure in more customers with new tools, including a service called Amazon Bedrock that provides companies with access to AI models they can use to make their own applications.

During a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company spent more than $30 billion during the first half of the year on capital expenditures, the majority of it to boost infrastructure for AWS.

The numbers did not include sales from Amazon’s annual  Olsavsky said the company came up short on revenue growth in North America because customers were still being cautious with their spending and trading down to cheaper items.

"Chipmaker Intel to cut 15,000 jobs as tries to revive its business and compete with rivals","Chipmaker Intel says it is cutting 15% of its massive workforce — about 15,000 jobs — as it tries to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD",BARBARA ORTUTAY AP technology writer,"Chipmaker Intel says it is cutting 15% of its huge workforce — about 15,000 jobs — as it tries to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD. In a memo to staff, Intel Corp. CEO Pat Gelsinger said Thursday the company plans to save $10 billion in 2025. “Simply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate,” he wrote in the  The job cuts come in the heels of a disappointing quarter and forecast for the iconic chip maker founded in 1968 at the start of the PC revolution.  Next week, Gelsinger wrote, Intel will announce an “enhanced retirement offering” for eligible employees and offer an application program for voluntary departures.  “These decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I’ve done in my career,” he said. The bulk of the layoffs are expected to be completed this year.  The Santa Clara, California-based company is also suspending its stock dividend as part of a broader plan to cut costs.  Intel reported a loss for its second quarter along with a small revenue decline, and it forecast third-quarter revenues below Wall Street's expectations.  Its stock plunged 19% in after-hours trading, indicating that Intel could lose roughly $24 billion of its market value when the stock market opens Friday. The company posted a loss of $1.6 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the April-June period. That's down from a profit of $1.5 billion, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings excluding special items were 2 cents per share. Revenue slid 1% to $12.8 billion from $12.9 billion.  Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 10 cents per share on revenue of $12.9 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.  “Intel’s announcement of a significant cost-cutting plan including layoffs may bolster its near-term financials, but this move alone is insufficient to redefine its position in the evolving chip market,"" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. “The company faces a critical juncture as it leverages U.S. investment in domestic manufacturing and the surging global demand for AI chips to establish itself in chip fabrication.” Gelsinger noted in a conference call with analysts that Intel has previously said that its investments in the AI PC market would pressure its profit margins over the short term but should benefit the company in the long term. “We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026,” he said. Unlike its rivals like Nvidia, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. It has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S., competing with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC. Helped by Gelsinger's lobbying efforts since he took the company's helm in 2021, Intel has been a major beneficiary of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The Biden administration helped shepherd that through Congress amid concerns after the pandemic that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession. In March,  In September 2022, Biden praised Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised the company for plans to “build a workforce of the future” for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year. “The U.S. government wants to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, especially this is the area of advanced computer chips,” Bourne said. “And Intel has been kind of earmarked for this money. But there’s a lot of infrastructure that goes into this, there’s the building of these facilities, which are really highly specialized — and then you also need to upskill the local workforce where these plants are located. And so it takes time. This is not something that happens overnight.”  —— Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed from Washington. "
MrBeast's giant reality competition faces safety complaints from initial contestants,"YouTube’s biggest star MrBeast is facing complaints about the safety of contestants from the preliminary round of his ambitious “Beast Games” game show, which boasts 1,000 competitors hoping for a $5 million grand prize",THALIA BEATY Associated Press,"NEW YORK --  Some contestants complained online and to other YouTube influencers that they lacked regular access to food, water and medication during early production at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, and that some competitors were injured during the production.  A spokesperson for MrBeast said his team is reviewing the process and soliciting attendees’ feedback ahead of the next phase of production in Toronto. The stakes for “Beast Games” aren't just high for the contestants, but for MrBeast himself, whose real name Jimmy Donaldson, as well as the recipients of his brand of “stunt philanthropy"" that often entails direct gifts of cash or even houses. The complaints about the “Beast Games” production coincide with Donaldson’s  The show, which has already been picked up by Amazon Prime Video to air in 240 countries, is part of Donaldson's cultural expansion beyond YouTube — where his channel has 307 million subscribers, including countless young consumers who already purchase his Feastables line of candy or the burgers that bear his name. “My goal is to make the greatest show possible and prove YouTubers and creators can succeed on other platforms,” Donaldson said in a  Donaldson’s companies cast 2,000 people to take part in an initial tryout of sorts at Allegiant Stadium in July, with 1,000 of them presumably advancing to the actual show. Amazon Prime Video was not involved and did not respond to a request for comment. A MrBeast spokesperson said Friday that the promotional video shoot was “unfortunately complicated” by extreme weather, the  We “have taken steps to ensure that we learn from this experience and we are excited to welcome hundreds of men and women to the world’s largest game show in history,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. MrBeast offered eliminated contestants $1,000 upon leaving the competition and the spokesperson said most of those who remain in contention are ready to keep going. Some contestants expected challenges similar to those from the dystopian Netflix show “Squid Game,” a fictional series — and eventual reality game show — where deeply indebted people compete for millions in high-stakes children’s games. The Associated Press reached out to several contestants about “Beast Games,” but most either did not respond or declined to speak on the record because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Scott Leopold, a 53-year-old father from Austin, Texas, told the AP he thought he was competing in the actual “Beast Games,” not a precursor to the show. He said he felt deceived about his chances of winning and that the competition in Las Vegas would not stream on Amazon Prime Video. He said that Donaldson should not be “villainized” but added that “an apology would go a long way.” “All I can conclude is that he was in over his head,” Leopold said. “There were too many people, and I don’t think he knew how to handle the situation.” Nancy Libby, a Navy veteran from California who said she was one of the last people eliminated, told AP that she applied after seeing a casting call on Facebook. Her daughters watch MrBeast videos, she said, and she’d already planned to take off work anyway. On-set conditions met her expectations. Libby said she was instructed by recruiters beforehand to watch previous MrBeast challenges to gain some understanding of the experience. Because of that, she said, she was unsurprised by meals of oatmeal and nights spent sleeping on the floor. Libby said that “crowd control” was an issue at times and that more staffing could help ensure competitors do not injure their counterparts. But Libby said the MrBeast team appeared to take safety seriously and that she only witnessed rude behavior from outside contractors. “Sometimes when you run things that are first of their kind, things come up that you can’t foresee,” Libby said. “I think that the template was there for a really good competition.” MrBeast has also previously had some contentious relationships with its contractors. One of Donaldson’s companies sued and then was countersued by a vendor they worked with on the “MrBeast Burger"" that got widely panned. Fans have also previously complained about not receiving merchandise they ordered from MrBeast or receiving the wrong items or wrong sizes.

About half of US state AGs went on France trip sponsored by group with lobbyist and corporate funds,About half the U.S. state attorneys general have traveled to France for an event cosponsored by a group largely funded by companies,GEOFF MULVIHILL Associated Press,"About half the U.S. state attorneys general traveled to France in a trip cosponsored by a group mostly funded by companies, including some under scrutiny of the top state lawyers. Attorneys general are among the most visible officials in state governments and the job can be a launching pad to the world stage. Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, previously held the post in California. Joining together gives AGs a chance to share concerns, develop bonds and strategies and talk with officials in other countries. The trips can be posh and provide opportunities for company lobbyists to rub elbows with them. Companies that have picked up the bill and sent representatives in recent years have been from the pharmaceutical, auto, financial, online gaming and tech industries, among others. Organizers said this summer's trip is “solely focused on commemorating and paying tribute to the achievements and sacrifices of those who fought in Normandy,” even though they are taking place nearly two months after the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on June 6, which was commemorated by a gathering of world leaders. The National Association of Attorneys General, known as AGA, a century-old organization that cosponsored the trip to France for attorneys general, would not provide dates for the event, but one AG said it was set for July 29 to Aug. 3. The trip illuminates how corporate lawyers and lobbyists can gain access to officials who regulate their businesses with help from the Attorney General Alliance, one of the groups behind the event. “Lobbyists essentially fund these trips,” said Christopher Toth, a former AGA executive director. “They funnel the money through AGA, and then that insulates the AGs from being criticized that they’re taking money from lobbyists.” It also shields them from criticism that they are traveling abroad on taxpayers' dime. The AGA said 26 attorneys general were going on the trip. The nonprofit group said  The group said it would not make public the 2024 schedule or exactly which AGs were attending in France because of security concerns. “This event, like all others, was scheduled based on availability of attorneys general and hotel  Maestas declined to answer whether any of the corporate sponsors were giving attorneys general tickets to Olympic games. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, a Democrat, said she would be attending an Olympic soccer game in addition to the Normandy events and that the tickets, and a few days of a vacation in France with her husband, would be at her expense. Other AGs said they would not attend the games or ignored queries from The Associated Press. Attorneys general are the chief government lawyers in their states. All of them have roles in consumer protection and many in law enforcement. They are elected in 43 states and appointed in the other seven. A big shift in the job began in the 1990s, when the states banded together to sue the tobacco industry over dangers caused by smoking. The deal opened the door for other huge multistate lawsuits and  That use of the office — ensuring corporate accountability — gave rise to other developments. Now, some major law firms have departments specializing in representing companies that come under the scrutiny of AGs. Those departments, which frequently employ former AGs or their deputies, have all the motivation to lobby people in the job, as do the companies they represent. Over time, the Conference of Western Attorneys General expanded its core topics from largely regional concerns such as water resources and challenges facing Native American communities to a broader range of issues and in 2019 they created the nationwide AGA. The group's tax filings show it both brought in and spent about $10 million from July 2022 through June 2023. More than $6 million in expenses were on travel, conferences and meetings and events. Much of the organization's revenue has come in the form of sponsorships. While the tax filings do not list the donors, an AGA brochure from 2023, provided by a lawyer specializing in AG practice who requested anonymity because of fear of professional retribution, shows how it works: Corporate sponsors could send more people to AGA events by contributing more money. For instance, $20,000 contributors could have three seats at events during the year. Those who gave $150,000 could have 30. More than 200 companies were listed as sponsors at various levels.  The AGA did not respond to questions about the brochure. “With the AGA, you have these regulated industries outright giving money to the organization,” said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political scientist who studies AGs. Brian Frosh, a Democrat who served as Maryland’s attorney general from 2015 until last year, said he recalled attending just one or two of the group's dinners early in his time in office but he did not attend any of the larger events, which have included international trips to China, Morocco, Ireland and elsewhere. “The dinners that I went to, you would sit next to a lobbyist for a different interest,” Frosh said. “And then you’d get up and move to another table. I didn’t find that to be enjoyable or educational.” A 2021 version of the AGA publication shows two companies contributed at least $500,000 that year: Amazon and Pfizer.  Both have come under scrutiny from AGs. Last year, 17 attorneys general joined with the Federal Trade Commission  Drugmaker Pfizer has faced legal action from AGs on multiple fronts. Texas AG Ken Paxton sued last year, claiming the company misrepresented the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccines and tried to censor public discourse about it. Pfizer also has been a target of multiple AG lawsuits over drug prices. Colin Provost, an associate professor of public policy at University College London who studies U.S. state AGs, said events where they mingle with lobbyists don't necessarily help companies get the outcomes they hope for. “The optics are often not good,” he said. “In terms of actually proving that this has sort of a corrupting influence, that’s harder to do.” ___ Associated Press reporters from around the U.S. contributed to this article.

Apple breaks out of recent sales slump as it gears up to make its leap into the AI craze,Apple snapped out of a prolonged sales slump during its most-recent quarter,MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP technology writer,"Apple snapped out of a prolonged sales slump during its most recent quarter as the trendsetting company prepares to launch into the artificial intelligence craze with an arsenal of new technology that’s expected to juice demand for its next iPhone. The fiscal third-quarter results announced Thursday covered an April-June period that’s typically a sluggish stretch for Apple as its loyal customer bases awaits the next version of the iPhone that’s traditionally unveiled shortly after Labor Day. Even so, Apple boosted its sales from a year ago — a welcome reversal of fortune on the heels of  This time around, Apple’s revenue rose 5% from a year to $85.78 billion — a figure that exceeded analysts’ projections. The Cupertino, California, company earned $21.45 billion, or $1.40 per share, an 8% increase from the same time last year. The profit also topped analyst forecasts. Apple's shares swung between slight increases and modest declines in Thursday's extended trading as investors assessed the results.  Sales of the iPhone — Apple’s marquee product — remained on a downward slope though, dipping 1% from last year to $39.3 billon. That decrease wasn’t as bad as the January-March period when iPhone sales plummeted 10% from last year, and now the product appears headed toward a major upswing. That’s because Apple is planning to roll out  The next model, the iPhone 16, is expected to be equipped with the AI chip — a factor that analysts believe will spur consumers who have been holding on to their older devices to splurge on upgrades so they can take advantage of the new features. That expectation is the main reason why Apple’s stock price has surged 13% since the company previewed its AI tools in early June — a run-up that has created about $400 billion in shareholder wealth so far. “I believe it will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Thursday conference call.  Apple’s push into AI may also fuel its steadily growing services division, which saw its revenue climb 14% from last year to $24.21 billion in the most recent quarter. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it's confronting regulatory threats that could drag down its performance.

"Protecting against floods, or a government-mandated retreat from the shore? New Jersey rules debated",New Jersey officials are defending proposed building rules designed to limit damage from future storms and steadily rising seas in coastal areas,WAYNE PARRY Associated Press,"TOMS RIVER, N.J. --  Lawmakers from both parties held a hearing Thursday in Toms River, one of the hardest-hit communities by Superstorm Sandy, to discuss the state's Protecting Against Climate Threats initiative and respond to criticism of the proposal from business interests. Mandated by an 2020 executive order from Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, the proposed rules are designed to account for rising seas and a changing climate in making land use decisions near the ocean, bays and rivers in an effort to limit damage from future storms. The rules would extend the jurisdiction of flood control measures further inland, require buildings to be constructed five feet (1.5 meters) higher off the ground than current rules call for, and require elevating roadways in flood-prone areas. They are to be published soon in the New Jersey Register, and subject to public comment before taking effect later this year. Other states and cities are considering or doing similar climate-based updates to development rules or acquisition of flood-prone properties, including North Carolina, Massachusetts, Fort Worth, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee. Nick Angarone, New Jersey's chief resilience officer, said proposed rules are necessary to “be clear-eyed about what is happening right before us.” He said New Jersey ranks third in the nation in flooding claims paid by the federal government at $5.8 billion since 1978. Angarone and others cited a Rutgers University study projecting that sea levels in New Jersey will rise by 2.1 feet (65 centimeters) by 2050 and 5.1 feet (1.5 meters) by the end of the century. By that time, he said, there is a 50% chance that Atlantic City will experience so-called “sunny-day flooding” every day. The New Jersey Business and Industry Association pushed back hard against the rules and the study upon which they are based, warning that the initiative is the start of a much-debated “managed retreat” from the shoreline that some scientists say needs to happen but that is anathema to many business groups. ""It will significantly harm the economy of our shore and river communities, and is premised on the policy that people and businesses should be forced to retreat from the coast,” said Ray Cantor, an official with the group and a former advisor to the Department of Environmental Protection under Republican Gov. Chris Christie. “We do believe that we need to consider sea level rise in our planning efforts,"" he said. “However, this rule is based on flawed scientific assumptions and will force a retreat from the Jersey Shore and coastal communities.” Rutgers defended its projections as consistent with 2021 sea-level projections for Atlantic City of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “a trusted, highly credible, heavily reviewed source of information for climate change.” Cantor claimed the new rules will create “no-build zones” in parts of the shore where it will simply be too costly and onerous to comply with the new requirements.

Book Review: 'The Future Was Now' is a brilliant look back at the groundbreaking movie summer of '82,"In “The Future Was Now,” former Entertainment Weekly film critic Chris Nashawaty explores the significance of the summer of 1982, which featured the release of eight groundbreaking science fiction and fantasy films",MIKE HOUSEHOLDER Associated Press,"The moments are seared into the pop culture pantheon.

In the ultra-entertaining and informative “The Future Was Now: Madmen, Mavericks, and the Epic Sci-Fi Summer of 1982,” Nashawaty makes the case that the octet of flicks altered the trajectory, not only of the auteurs at the helm, but of Hollywood filmmaking. “The summer of 1982 was the moment when sci-fi, fantasy, and splashy blockbusters ripped from the pages of comic books would grow up,” Nashawaty writes. ""These films could no longer be nonchalantly dismissed as kids' stuff. “They became the harbingers of a new era and eventually the most dominant force in popular entertainment.” His thesis is solid, sure.

Stock market today: Dow drops 600 on weak jobs data as a global sell-off whips back to Wall Street,Stocks tumbled Friday on worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to whip inflation,STAN CHOE AP business writer,"NEW YORK --  The S A report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates. It was just  Now, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through. “The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They’ll have to do something bigger than” the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point “to avert a recession.” Traders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That’s even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is “not something we’re thinking about right now.” Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it’s walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen.  While refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials “have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness” in the job market after hiking its main rate so high.  “Certainly today’s job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,” said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. “Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.”  U.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street. Several big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from  Amazon fell 8.8% after reporting  Intel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company’s profit for the latest quarter  Apple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting  Apple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “  Friday’s losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a “correction.” Helpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market.

"Heat deaths of people without air conditioning, often in mobile homes, underscore energy inequity",Advocates say air conditioning is no longer a luxury but a public health and affordability issue,ANITA SNOW Associated Press,"PHOENIX --  For the last dozen years, the 61-year-old spent much of the year working near Pasco, Washington, sending money to his wife and daughters in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, Mexico, and traveling back every Christmas.  Now, the family is raising money to bring his remains home. “If this motor home would have had AC and it was running, then it most likely would have helped,” said Franklin County Coroner Curtis McGary, who determined Vazquez Navarro's death was heat-related, with alcohol intoxication as a contributing cause.  Most heat-related deaths involve homeless people living outdoors. But those who die inside without sufficient cooling also are vulnerable, typically older than 60, living alone and  Underscoring the  “Air conditioning is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, which represents state energy assistance programs. “It’s a public health issue and it’s an affordability issue.”  People living in mobile homes or in aging trailers and RVs are especially likely to lack proper cooling. Nearly a quarter of the indoor heat deaths in Arizona's Maricopa County last year were in those kinds of dwellings, which are transformed into a broiling tin can by the blazing desert sun.  “Mobile homes can really heat up because they don’t always have the best insulation and are often made of metal,” said Dana Kennedy, AARP director in Arizona, where many heat-related deaths occur. Research “People are exposed to the elements more than in other housing,” said Patricia Solís, executive director of the  Worse, some parks bar residents from making modifications that could cool their homes, citing esthetic concerns. A new Arizona law required parks for the first time this summer to let residents install cooling methods such as window units, shade awnings and shutters. In Arizona’s Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, 156 of  One victim was Shirley Marie Kouplen, who died after being overcome by high temperatures inside her Phoenix mobile home amid a  Emergency responders recorded the 70-year-old widow's body temperature at 107.1 F (41.7 C). Kouplen, who was diabetic and had high blood pressure, was rushed to a hospital, where she died. Kouplen apparently was struggling financially, if the shabby condition of her mobile home was any indication. It still sits on Lot 60, surrounded by a chain-link fence with a locked gate and a dirt driveway overgrown with weeds.  It's unclear how the cord got unplugged, if Kouplen had an electricity account or how she got her power.  “Losing your air conditioning is now a life-threatening event,” said Texas A Arizona’s regulated utilities have been banned since 2022 from cutting off power during the summer, following the 2018 death of a 72-year-old woman after Arizona Public Service disconnected her electricity over a $51 debt. Ann Porter, spokesperson for Arizona Public Service, which provides electricity to homes in the park where Kouplen lived, said “due to privacy concerns” the company could not say if she had an account at the time of her death or in the past. Porter said the utility does not cut power from June 1 to Oct. 15.  Cutoffs can occur after those dates if mounting debts are not paid.  Arizona is among 19 states with shut-off protections, leaving about half of the U.S. population without safeguards against losing electricity during the summer, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association said in a  Almost 20% of very-low income families have no air conditioning at all, especially in places like Washington state where they weren't commonly installed before climate-fueled heat waves grew increasingly stronger, frequent and longer lasting.  In the Pacific Northwest, several hundred people died during a 2021 heat wave, prompting Portland, Oregon, to launch  Chicago, better known for its cold winters, saw a heat wave kill 739 mostly older people over five days in 1995. Amid high humidity and temperatures over 100 degrees (37.7 C), most victims had no air conditioning or couldn’t afford to turn on their units. In 2022, Chicago adopted a cooling ordinance after three women died in their apartments in a building for older adults on an unusually warm spring day. Certain residential buildings must now have at least one air conditioned common area for cooling when the heat index exceeds 80 degrees (26.6 C) and cooling is unavailable in individual units. Nonprofits in historically hotter areas like Arizona also are trying to better address the inequities low-income people face during the sweltering summers.

Phoenix landlords must ensure air conditioning units cool to 82 degrees (28 C) or below and that evaporative coolers lower the temperature to 86 degrees (30 C). Palm Springs, California, and Las Vegas, both desert cities, have ordinances requiring landlords to offer air conditioning in rental dwellings. Dallas, where temperatures can pass 110 degrees (43.3 C) in the summer, has a similar law. But most renters pay their own electricity costs, leaving them to agonize whether they can afford to even turn on the cooling or how high to set the thermostat.

Federal judge overturns $4.7 billion jury verdict in 'Sunday Ticket' lawsuit and rules for NFL,A federal judge overturned a jury’s $4.7 billion verdict in the class-action lawsuit filed by “Sunday Ticket” subscribers against the NFL and granted judgment to the NFL,JOE REEDY AP sports writer,"LOS ANGELES --  U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez ruled Thursday that the testimony of two witnesses for the subscribers had flawed methodologies and should have been excluded. “Without the testimonies of Dr. (Daniel) Rascher and Dr. (John) Zona, no reasonable jury could have found class-wide injury or damages,” Gutierrez wrote at the end of his 16-page ruling. On June 27 the jury awarded $4.7 billion in damages to residential and commercial subscribers after it ruled the NFL violated antitrust laws in distributing out-of-market Sunday afternoon games on a premium subscription service. The lawsuit covered 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses in the United States who paid for the package on DirecTV of out-of-market games from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.  “We are grateful for today’s ruling in the Sunday Ticket class action lawsuit,” the NFL said in a statement. “We believe that the NFL’s media distribution model provides our fans with an array of options to follow the game they love, including local broadcasts of every single game on free over-the-air television. We thank Judge Gutierrez for his time and attention to this case and look forward to an exciting 2024 NFL season.” Calls and emails to the attorneys representing “Sunday Ticket” subscribers were not returned. The jury of five men and three women found the NFL liable for $4,610,331,671.74 in damages to the residential class (home subscribers) and $96,928,272.90 in damages to the commercial class (business subscribers). Because damages can be tripled under federal antitrust laws, the NFL could have been liable for $14,121,779,833.92. Gutierrez did say in his decision that if he did not rule for the NFL as a matter of law, he would have vacated the jury's damages verdict and conditionally grant a new trial “based on the jury’s irrational damages award.” Rascher's models were variations of a college football model. Rascher, an economist at the University of San Francisco, said during his testimony that “they figured it out in college sports, (so) they would certainly figure it out at the NFL.” Gutierrez said Rascher's testimony “was not the product of sound economic methodology” and that he needed to explain how out-of-market telecasts would have been available on cable and satellite without an additional subscription. Gutierrez also found flaws in Zona's “multiple distributor” models because it predicted consumers would have paid more if another service besides DirecTV offered “Sunday Ticket” and there was an unsupported assumption that another distributor — either cable, satellite or streaming — would have been available. “Without knowing what “direct-to-consumer” meant, it is impossible to determine if it would have been economically rational for consumers to purchase ”Sunday Ticket"" from an alternative distributor at a higher price,"" Gutierrez said. ""And, that definition was necessary for determining whether a viable alternative distributor even existed during the class period. Without that information, the Court cannot determine whether the but-for worlds without exclusivity were modeled reliably. The jury’s amount also did not conform to Rascher's model ($7.01 billion) by Daniel Rascher, or the model ($3.48 billion) by Zona, who was an expert witness in the case. Instead, the jury used the 2021 list price of $293.96 and subtracted $102.74, the average price actually paid by residential Sunday Ticket subscribers. The jury then used $191.26, which it considered as the “overcharge,” and multiplied that by the number of subscribers to come up with the damages amount. Gutierrez said the jury did not follow his instructions and ""instead relied on inputs not tied to the record to create its own ‘overcharge.’” It is not the first time the NFL has won a judgment as matter of law in this case, which has been going on since 2015. In 2017, U.S. District Judge Beverly Reid O’Connell dismissed the lawsuit and ruled for the NFL because she said “Sunday Ticket” did not reduce output of NFL games and that even though DirecTV might have charged inflated prices, that did not “on its own, constitute harm to competition” because it had to negotiate with the NFL to carry the package.  Two years later, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the case.  It is likely the plaintiffs will again appeal to the 9th Circuit. ___ AP NFL:  "
Shares sink in Japan as a tech-driven retreat on Wall St drives selling of chip makers and exporters,Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has dropped nearly 6% after a broad retreat on Wall Street,The Associated Press,"TOKYO --  The drop of more than 2,000 points to its close at 35,909.70 left the index near where it was in January, erasing huge gains that had taken the Nikkei index past the 40,000 level as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence drove shares in computer chipmakers and other related companies sharply higher.  The Nikkei had hit an all-time high of 42,224.02 on July 11.  Oct. 19, 1987, was dubbed Black Monday after shares plunged worldwide, with the Tokyo index dropping 3,836.48, or nearly 15%, and other world markets sinking far more. Investors dumped shares in the belief that prices were too high.  Then, Japan's markets recovered relatively quickly because the country was still in the midst of a financial bubble that would take the Nikkei to nearly 39,000 before it collapsed in early 1990. The Nikkei did not recover that earlier peak of 38,915.87 until earlier this year.  Friday's decline in Japan and in other world markets followed a retreat on Wall Street after weak data raised worries the Federal Reserve may have missed its window to cut interest rates before it undercuts economic growth. Analysts said traders also were selling Japanese shares to position themselves to buy U.S. equities.  ""I think markets globally are having a headless chicken moment,” the financial outlet Nikkei Asia cited Nicholas Smith of analyst CLSA as saying.  Japanese shares have been pummeled after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, to a modest 0.25% from 0.1%.

Nintendo reports trailing profit as sales of aging Switch game console slide,Japanese video game maker Nintendo has reported a 55% drop in its profit in the April-June quarter as sales slipped in both machines and game software,YURI KAGEYAMA AP business writer,"TOKYO --  Game machine sales tend to trail off after they hit the market.  Profit at Nintendo Co., owner of the Super Mario and Pokemon franchises, totaled 80.95 billion yen ($543 million) in the last quarter, down from 181 billion yen a year earlier. Quarterly sales declined 46.5% to 246.6 billion yen ($1.7 billion).  Nintendo did not release any new information about a promised Switch successor.

Software sales declined 41%, despite million-seller games including a take on the Super Mario series called “Paper Mario,” and a new Luigi game.

"Turkey blocks access to Instagram. It's in response to removal of posts on Hamas chief, reports say",Turkey’s communications authority has blocked access to the social media platform Instagram,SUZAN FRASER Associated Press,"ANKARA, Turkey --  The Information and Communication Technologies Authority, which regulates the internet, announced the decision early Friday but did not provide a reason.  Yeni Safak newspaper, which is close to the government, and other media said access was blocked in response to Instagram removing posts by Turkish users that expressed condolences over the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. “Sanctions for Instagram’s blackout policy were swift. The Information Technologies and Communication Authority blocked access to Instagram,” Yeni Safak stated in its online edition. Earlier, Fahrettin Altun, the presidential communications director and aide to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had strongly criticized the Meta-owned platform for preventing users in Turkey from posting messages of condolences for Haniyeh. The transportation and infrastructure minister, Abdulkadir Uraloglu, maintained that Instagram had ignored “sensitivities” and was in breach of a so-called inventory of serious crimes, which include incitement to suicide, torture, obscenity, crimes against the state’s security and child sexual abuse, among others. He did not elaborate which particular crime the platform is alleged to have breached. “When they don’t abide by laws and our regulations and don’t take our societal sensitivities into consideration, we are obliged to make the necessary interventions,” he said.  The minister said Turkish authorities were in contact with Instagram’s representative in Turkey. “When they fulfill the requirements, we will lift the ban,” he said. Uraloglu's deputy, Omer Fatih Sayan, wrote on X: “We will do what is needed to establish a social media that respects our values, is free of disinformation, and is cleaner and more secure.” There was no immediate comment from Instagram, which has over 50 million users in Turkey, a nation with a population of 85 million. Unlike its Western allies, Turkey does not consider Hamas to be a terror organization. A  The country is observing a day of mourning for Haniyeh on Friday, during which flags are being flown at half-staff. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul and a member of Turkey's main opposition party, denounced the decision to block Instagram, accusing the communications authority of acting like a “censorship unit.” “Social media is a platform that everyone uses for many purposes, including for commerce and communicating,” Imamoglu wrote on X. “It is unacceptable that a platform used by the entire country is arbitrarily shut down one morning.” Turkey has a track record of censoring social media and websites. Hundreds of thousands of domains have been blocked since 2022, according to the Freedom of Expression Association, a non-profit organization regrouping lawyers and human rights activists. The video-sharing platform YouTube was blocked from 2007 to 2010. "
US safety agency moves probe of Dodge Journey fire and door lock failure a step closer to a recall,U.S. auto safety regulators are a step closer to seeking a recall of nearly a million Dodge Journey SUVs after a woman was trapped and died in a 2022 vehicle fire,The Associated Press,"DETROIT --  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration upgraded an investigation opened last year  The agency says in documents posted on its website Friday that it now has 19 complaints from owners and the automaker that inoperative door locks and windows can prevent people from getting out of the small SUVs during an emergency. There were no additional fires, injuries or deaths.  The probe started with Journeys from the 2009 model year, but has been expanded to include those sold through 2020. Agency documents say investigators will look at the cause of the fire “and its potential effect on the actuation of the door locks.” Stellantis, which makes Dodge vehicles, said in a statement that the company is cooperating in the investigation and extends sympathy to the woman's family. NHTSA says it also will explore other possible causes for any door lock malfunctions. The Journey owner’s manual says the doors can be unlocked manually by pulling up a plunger on the top of the door trim panel. A complaint filed with the agency before the investigation began says the woman pulled to the side of a road when warning lights started flashing, windshield wipers came on, the horn started honking, windows wouldn’t go down and the doors wouldn’t unlock. The complaint alleged that fire apparently started in the engine and spread, trapping her inside. “The driver was unable to exit the vehicle, resulting in her death,” the agency wrote in documents. Agency documents don’t say where the fire happened, but  Frahm had called her fiance and told him she pulled to the side of the road after the Journey started having electrical problems. Later she called back and said smoke was coming from the dashboard and she could smell burning, the newspaper said. She called 911, but by the time first responders had arrived, flames had engulfed the SUV, the newspaper reported. In 2009, Chrysler LLC recalled about 17,000 Journeys because an unused electrical connector could corrode and short circuit, potentially causing a fire, according to NHTSA documents. Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said in 2023 that drivers should try to pull up the plunger first to escape if their vehicle’s electrical system malfunctions. Beyond that, escape is difficult because many windows now have plastic laminated between two layers of glass and are difficult to shatter. He suggested keeping a metal tool in the car and becoming familiar with which windows are tempered glass and can be shattered with the tool. Laminated glass, he said, helps to prevent people from being thrown from cars in a crash. He said there’s a need to standardize a way to unlock doors or somehow escape from all cars. "

"Trump is wrong about immigrants taking 'Black jobs,' economists say",The former president made the inaccurate claim this week.,Max Zahn,"Former President Donald Trump this week  ""Coming from the border are millions and millions of people who happen to be taking Black jobs,"" Trump said at a gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago. ""They're taking the employment from Black people."" Trump has delivered the same dire warning about an immigrant threat to Black employment on multiple occasions throughout the 2024 campaign, including at a debate with President Joe Biden in June. Economists who spoke to ABC News dismissed the claim as false. In fact, they said, a tight  ""The claim is absolutely not true,"" Valerie Wilson, the director of a program on race, ethnicity and the economy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute Action, told ABC News. In a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign claimed that undocumented immigrants pose a threat to Black employment. ""Illegal immigration disproportionally affects Black workers, including other minority workers, and we need to do everything to protect them from their jobs from being taken away,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said. Cheung noted that the the current Black unemployment rate of 6.3% is higher than its lowest level under Trump of 5.3%. Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for Black workers currently stand lower than they did at their high point under Trump, Cheung added. ""That is why President Trump has promised the largest deportation operation in American history since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Kamala Harris will give amnesty and citizenship to all 15 million illegal aliens and make permanent the assault on Black American jobs,"" Cheung added. The all-time lowest figure for Black unemployment recorded in a single month registered at 4.8% in April 2023 during Biden's term. Last year, the average Black unemployment rate stood at 5.5%, setting a record for the lowest figure over a calendar year,  To be sure, the unemployment rate stood much higher than the 3.3% unemployment rate among white workers in 2023. Historically, the Black unemployment rate has clocked in roughly twice as high as that of white people, due in large part to continued racial discrimination among employers, economists  Another key metric has shown robust job gains among Black workers. Last year, the share of job holders between the ages of 25 to 54 -- known as the ""prime age"" for workers -- reached an all-time high of nearly 78% among Black people, the  ""The bottom line is immigrants aren't pushing out Black workers,"" Christian Weller, a professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston who studies racial disparities in employment, told ABC News. ""It isn't particularly surprising,"" Weller added. That's because immigrants act not only as workers but also as consumers, helping fuel demand for goods and services, which in turn propels economic activity and drives up hiring, he said. The economy has grown at a solid pace in recent years, defying fears among some observers of a potential slowdown. Gross domestic product  In June, a budget outlook released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said immigration would account for a sizable share of U.S. economic growth over the coming decade. In all, the U.S. GDP will rise nearly $9 trillion higher than it would otherwise due to an anticipated influx of immigrants, the CBO  ""At the heart of this question is not just that these are people who are filling jobs that need to be filled, but they are also paying taxes, raising their families, and spending in the neighborhoods and communities in which they live,"" Michelle Holder, a labor economist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told ABC News. When speaking about the issue this week, Trump falsely characterized immigrants as a threat to ""Black jobs."" That phrase ""Black jobs,"" which Trump used previously, drew condemnation from some economists. Holder, who is also Black, said the term invokes a period of U.S. history that predates anti-discrimination laws, when some job listings explicitly described jobs as available only to Black applicants. ""I get a visceral reaction because there was a time in this country when there was work considered only suitable for Black people,"" Holder said. When asked about the phrase on Wednesday at the gathering of the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump said: ""A Black job is anybody that has a job. That's what it is."" Wilson, of Economic Policy Institute Action, also criticized the phrase, in part because it fails to acknowledge the issue of ""occupational segregation,"" in which employers tend to place Black workers in low-wage positions rather than high-wage ones. The U.S., she added, has made progress in addressing that trend in recent years, though it remains an impediment for wage gains among Black workers. ""It's just a very poor choice of words in terms of trying to say anything about the labor market, and it's a poor choice of words in particular because it's offensive,"" said Wilson, who is Black. ""It totally ignores the facts about the current economy and the improvement that we've seen over the last four years,"" Wilson added. "

North Dakota voters will decide whether to abolish property taxes,North Dakota voters will decide in November whether to eliminate property taxes,JACK DURA Associated Press,"BISMARCK, N.D. --  Secretary of State Michael Howe's office said Friday that backers submitted more than enough signatures to qualify the  Property taxes are the base funding for numerous local government services, including sewers, water, roads, jails, deputies, school building construction and teacher salaries — “pretty much the most basic of government,” said North Dakota Association of Counties Executive Director Aaron Birst. Rising property taxes, often fueled by rising home values, have frustrated people across the U.S. North Dakota's initiative qualified for the ballot as  The campaign in North Dakota is happening as the state is experiencing good finances, especially strong oil and sales taxes. The leader of the measure drive, former Republican state Rep. Rick Becker, said it would help provide property tax relief. He said people often don’t fully understand the process around property valuations and taxation. “They don't think it's fair. They just wait to get a letter in the mail telling them what their home is now valued at, and that increase in value causes increase in taxes. But yet everyone seems to pass the buck because the locals say, 'Well, we didn't raise your taxes' — well, we're paying more taxes,” said Becker, a plastic surgeon in Bismarck and unsuccessful  If the measure passes, the state would have to replace over $1.3 billion a year beginning in 2025, according to a preliminary  Becker said local governments would still be in charge of their budgets and for generating revenue they would need above the flat, annual amount the state would replace. He floated a combination of a “municipal operations” and infrastructure maintenance fee or tax for every household and business. Those would be more fair and transparent, he said. Where the replacement revenue comes from is up to the Legislature, Becker said. He suggested a portion could come from earnings of the state's $10.7 billion  Keep It Local, a coalition of groups with ties to agriculture, education, health care, public safety and other areas, opposes the measure, saying residents could face “profound consequences"" if property taxes are eliminated. “The measure to eliminate property tax threatens our ability to fund essential services locally, tasks our state legislature with covering a funding gap of approximately $1.3 billion per year, and jeopardizes the quality of life we cherish in our neighborhoods and towns,"" Chad Oban, Keep It Local chair, said in a statement. The ballot measure would present a monumental task for the Legislature's budget writers, who would have to rethink funding of myriad items, said Republican state Rep. Don Vigesaa, who leads the House Appropriations Committee. The Legislature's research agency already has put together a tentative list of areas and programs where funding could be taken, such as the state's “Operation Prairie Dog” infrastructure fund, he said.

"Nebraska, Ohio State, Alabama raise NIL funds at football practice through fan admission, autographs","Tradition-rich college football programs Nebraska, Ohio State and Alabama are capitalizing on the passion of their fans to generate funds for their NIL collectives",ERIC OLSON AP college football writer,"LINCOLN, Neb. --  Nebraska and Ohio State are opening one or more of their preseason practices to the public and charging admission. Alabama will let fans in for free to an open practice, but those who want to get player autographs afterward will be required to pay a few bucks to join the Crimson Tide's collective. NFL teams have long allowed fans to attend training camps, with most charging no admission. College athletes have been  Schools that struggle to fill their stadiums during the season probably would never ask fans to pay to watch a practice. It can work at places like Nebraska and Ohio State, which have long ranked among leaders in attendance and whose spring games, which are glorified practices, regularly draw between 60,000 and 80,000. Temple University associate professor Thilo Kunkel, who researches NIL’s impact on college sports, said opening practices for a price is a creative way to add to the NIL pool if a school can pull it off. Even though the players won't be in full pads and temperatures could be in the 90s, hardcore fans will come for an up-close look at the team. “They want more than just a Saturday afternoon game,"" Kunkel said. ""They want that authentic behind-the-scenes access and the practices actually are giving them that.” Nebraska is charging $25 per fan, any age, for its open 6 p.m. practice Saturday. Carson Schott, CEO of the 1890 collective, estimated 3,000 fans would show up.  “Husker fans are the most loyal, passionate fan base in the country!” Schott said in an email to The Associated Press. “We knew this event would have great support in helping Husker Athletics and 1890. The opportunity to watch and see how practice is run is a unique opportunity that is usually reserved for large donors. We couldn’t be more excited!” Cornhuskers coach Matt Rhule said Nebraska doesn't plan to charge for events that have traditionally been free, such as the annual Fan Day. “But moving forward in this new model, we have to find ways to raise revenue and to support 1890,” he said. “It’ll be a good practice. I want people to see the way that we practice. And at the end, we’ll have some fun.” Ohio State is charging $50 to attend one of four open practices, with the last one Sunday. Fans also get a pair of commemorative 2024 Ohio State training camp sunglasses and access to a FanFest. Attendance was capped at 750 per practice, meaning the Buckeyes could raise $150,000 for their NIL efforts if each practice sold out. Ohio State sold out two open practices last year, when tickets cost $30 and attendance was capped at 500. Alabama will let fans watch practice for free during its Fan Day on Aug. 11, but those who want to go through the autograph line will have to join the Yea Alabama collective. Memberships start at $18 per month. “The concept is really interesting,” Kunkel said. “It's basically top schools with brand value that can leverage that to generate extra funds. Even those top schools are facing the need to generate additional money because NIL compensation, as well as attracting players through NIL deals, is becoming more and more competitive.” ___ AP college football:  "
Pin-demonium hits Paris: Inside the pin-trading market at the Olympics,"On the other side of the Atlantic from Wall Street, a market more wholesome than cutthroat has sprung up at the Paris Olympics",RAPHAEL LEICESTER Associated Press,"PARIS --  The city has seen an influx of collectors from all over the world, each eager to begin or expand their Olympic pin collection and  “People are wired to trade. Human beings, we want to trade,” asserts Craig Robbins, a passionate pin collector from Los Angeles. “In life, if you cannot exchange, you die.” “Do you have any pins?” a Starbucks barista asks every journalist who comes in for coffee at the Palais des Congrès, the Olympics' main press center.  From bustling coffee shops to quiet streets, the same question has been echoing all over town, as Olympic volunteers, athletes, media workers, waiters, tourists and more all look for the same prized accessories.  “You can really feel the craze this year,” says French pin collector Laurent Facy.  The quest for pins has become an integral part of the Olympics, adding another layer of excitement to the Games. “It’s become a game; we trade a little bit like we used to at the playground,” he says. The tradition can be traced back to the first modern Olympic Games,  More than a century on, the badges have stretched and evolved into extremely detailed, intricate and, at times, technological pins, customized to participating countries, news organizations, brands and even people. “They’re like little pieces of art,” passionately declares Nicholas Wolaver, a dedicated American collector and trader. Los Angeles 1984 “You had media pins, sponsor pins, athlete pins, mascot pins. They found a way to really monetize pins for the public, and people were going crazy,” Wolaver says of those Games. After two Olympics  “Paris has been very good for pin collecting because after the pandemic, where you could not trade pins so much in Tokyo and Beijing, people are very excited,” Wolaver explains.  The pins' popularity has been boosted by social media and the fact that Olympians themselves are getting in on the game.  Britain's Andy Murray, the tennis player  “There’s one athlete from Liechtenstein and (Andy) was searching the village high and low for him to try and find this poor man,” she said. One of the buzziest pins at these Olympics is Snoop Dogg’s, which features  “What’s really cool is that Snoop Dogg made the youngests interested in pins too,” Robbins says.  The appeal of pin trading lies in its accessibility and inclusiveness. While the official Olympic competition is confined to stadiums, pin trading takes place everywhere — even online. (The Associated Press' own pins are already going for between $30-50 on eBay.) Wearing clothes seems to be the sole condition to participating. Traders and collectors adorn themselves — their badges, their shirts, their hats — with mosaics of multicolored pins, sparkling in the Paris summer light. Traders can spot each other from a distance, admiring each other’s weighty collection. The sight of a fellow collector’s vibrant display is often more than enough to spark a conversation. “Pins break down the walls where people can start talking to each other,” explains Robbins. “It was just a nice way to meet people,” adds Arr Alansod, sitting next to him in the street. And it doesn't just facilitate conversation with fellow enthusiasts. The pins serve as a draw for curious tourists and Olympics newcomers. “You get to meet a lot of people,” says Paul Ians, another American visitor and collector. “It’s not so much the other pin traders, it’s the regular people who are coming to the Olympics.” All seem to agree pins are a bridge between people, creating a platform for interesting encounters: “A lot of the time these strangers will tell you something you don’t know,” Ians says. Sometimes those strangers are a little higher-profile: In his 40 years of trading, French President Emmanuel Macron and  In essence, each pin holds a story, and through trading, people become storytellers, handing out pieces of their own personal, often Olympic tale. ___ For more coverage of the Paris Olympics, visit  "

Tesla attorneys ask judge to vacate decision invalidating massive pay package for Elon Musk,Attorneys for Elon Musk and Tesla’s corporate directors are asking a Delaware judge to vacate her ruling requiring the company to rescind a massive pay package for Musk,RANDALL CHASE AP business writer,"WILMINGTON, Del. --  Friday's hearing follows a January ruling in which Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick concluded that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in  Following the court ruling, Tesla shareholders  Defense attorneys say the vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out in her January ruling, are adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. “Honoring the shoulder vote would affirm the strength of our corporate system,” David Ross, an attorney for Musk and the other individual defendants, told McCormick. “This was stockholder democracy working.” Ross told the judge that the defendants were not challenging the factual findings or legal conclusions in her ruling, but simply asking that she vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package. McCormick, however, seemed skeptical of the defense arguments, peppering attorneys with questions and noting that there is no precedent in Delaware law for allowing a post-trial shareholder vote to ratify adjudicated breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate directors. “This has never been done before,” she said. Defense attorneys argued that, while they could find no case that is exactly comparable, Delaware law has long recognized shareholder ratification as a cure to corporate governance errors, and has long acknowledged the “sovereignty” of shareholders as the ultimate owners of a corporation. “I candidly don’t see how Delaware law can tell the owners of the company that they’re not entitled to make the decision they made,” said Rudolf Koch, an attorney for Tesla. Donald Verrilli, a lawyer for an induvial stockholder who owns more than 19,000 Tesla shares, suggested that it would be wrong for the lone shareholder who filed the lawsuit to thwart the will of the majority of Tesla shareholders. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff owned just nine shares of Tesla stock. “The voice of the majority of shareholders should matter…. This lawsuit is not representing the interest of the shareholders,"" Verrilli said. Thomas Grady, an attorney for a group of Florida objectors who own or manage almost 8 million Tesla shares with some $2 billion, argued that for McCormick to rule for the plaintiff, she has to “disenfranchise” all other Tesla shareholders. Greg Varallo, an attorney for the plaintiff, urged McCormick not to give any credence to the June shareholder vote, saying it has no legal precedent in Delaware or anywhere else. There also is no reason for the court to reopen the trial record and admit new evidence, he said. Under Delaware law, stockholders have no authority to overrule courts by trying to use a post-trial ratification vote as a “giant eraser,” Varallo argued. “Ratification is not magic, and it never has been,” Varallo added. “This should end here and now.” McCormick gave no indication on when she would rule. She also has yet to rule on a huge and unprecedented  "
"Justice Department sues TikTok, accusing the company of illegally collecting children's data","The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday, accusing the company of violating children’s online privacy law and running afoul of a settlement it had reached with another federal agency",HALELUYA HADERO AP business writer,"The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday, accusing the company of violating children’s online privacy law and running afoul of a settlement it had reached with another federal agency.  The complaint, filed together with the Federal Trade Commission in a California federal court, comes as the U.S. and the prominent social media company are embroiled in  The latest lawsuit focuses on allegations that TikTok, a trend-setting platform popular among young users, and its China-based parent company ByteDance violated a federal law that requires kid-oriented apps and websites to get parental consent before collecting personal information of children under 13. It also says the companies failed to honor requests from parents who wanted their children's accounts deleted, and chose not to delete accounts even when the firms knew they belonged to kids under 13.  “This action is necessary to prevent the defendants, who are repeat offenders and operate on a massive scale, from collecting and using young children’s private information without any parental consent or control,” Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, said in a statement. TikTok said it disagreed with the allegations, “many of which relate to past events and practices that are factually inaccurate or have been addressed.”  “We offer age-appropriate experiences with stringent safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users and have voluntarily launched features such as default screentime limits, Family Pairing, and additional privacy protections for minors,” the company said in a statement.  The U.S. decided to file the lawsuit following  In 2019, the federal government sued Musical.ly, alleging it violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, by failing to notify parents about its collection and use of personal information for kids under 13. That same year, Musical.ly — acquired by ByteDance in 2017 and merged with TikTok — agreed to pay $5.7 million to resolve those allegations. The two companies were also subject to a court order requiring them to comply with COPPA, which the government says hasn’t happened.  In the complaint, the Justice Department and the FTC allege TikTok has knowingly allowed children to create accounts and retained their personal information without notifying their parents. This practice extends to accounts created in “Kids Mode,” a version of TikTok for children under 13. The feature allows users to view videos but bars them from uploading content. The two agencies allege the information collected included activities on the app and other identifiers used to build user profiles. They also accuse TikTok of sharing the data with other companies – such as Meta’s Facebook and an analytics company called AppsFlyer – to persuade “Kids Mode” users to be on the platform more, a practice TikTok called “re-targeting less active users.”  The complaint says TikTok also allowed children to create accounts without having to provide their age, or obtain parental approval, by using credentials from third-party services. It classified these as “age unknown” accounts, which the agencies say have grown into millions. After parents discovered some of their children’s accounts and asked for them to be deleted, federal officials said TikTok asked them to go through a convoluted process to deactivate them and frequently did not honor their requests. Overall, the government said TikTok employed deficient policies that were unable to prevent children's accounts from proliferating on its app and suggested the company was not taking the issue seriously. In at least some periods since 2019, the complaint said TikTok's human moderators spent an average of five to seven seconds reviewing accounts flagged as potentially belonging to a child. It also said TikTok and ByteDance have technology they can use to identify and remove children's accounts, but do not use them for that reason.  The alleged violations have resulted in millions of children under 13 using the regular TikTok app, allowing them to interact with adults and access adult content, the complaint said. In March, a person with the matter had told the AP the FTC’s investigation was also looking into whether TikTok violated a portion of federal law that prohibits “unfair and deceptive” business practices by denying that individuals in China had access to U.S. user data.  Those allegations were not included in the complaint, which is asking the court to fine the companies and enter a preliminary injunction to prevent future violations.  Other social media companies have also come under fire for how they’ve handled children’s data. In 2019, Google and YouTube agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle allegations that the popular video site had illegally collected personal information on children without their parents’ consent.  And last fall, dozens of U.S. states sued Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook and Instagram, for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.

Airline passenger gets 19-month sentence. US says he tried to enter cockpit and open an exit door,An airline passenger who tried to make a shank from plastic cutlery and open the cockpit door during a flight has been sentenced to 19 months in prison,The Associated Press,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. --  A federal judge in Missouri handed down the sentence Thursday against Juan Remberto Rivas, 52. Prosecutors sought a term of between 41 months and 51 months, although they said Rivas was affected by his use of methamphetamine and wasn’t trying to cause a crash. The incident happened on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., in February 2022. Witnesses told an FBI agent that Rivas tried to use plastic cutlery and his shirt sleeve to make a shank, pushed a service cart into a flight attendant, and tried to open both the cockpit door and one of the plane’s exit doors. A flight attendant hit him over the head with a metal coffee pot, and passengers subdued the man, according to court documents. Pilots landed in Kansas City, where Rivas was arrested. Rivas pleaded guilty in January to a single count of interfering with a flight crew. Prosecutors said he had two previous convictions, including assaulting a spouse or ex-spouse, and faces a charge of assaulting a law enforcement officer in Missouri. "

"Unemployment rise spurs fears of slowdown, yet recession signals have been wrong — so far",A surprising rise in the unemployment rate last month has rattled financial markets and set off new worries about the threat of a recession — but it could also prove to be a false alarm,CHRISTOPHER RUGABER AND PAUL WISEMAN AP economics writers,"WASHINGTON --  Friday’s jobs report, which also showed hiring slowed last month, coincides with other signs the economy is cooling amid  The U.S. economy used to flash reliable signals when it was in or near a recession. But those red lights have gone haywire since the COVID-19 pandemic struck and upended normal business activity. Over the past two or three years, they’ve signaled downturns that never arrived as the economy just kept rolling along. Worries about a recession are also quickly politicized, even more so as the presidential election intensifies. Former President Donald Trump's campaign on Friday said the jobs report is “more evidence that the Biden-Harris economy is failing Americans.” For his part, President Joe Biden said that since he and Vice President Kamala Harris took office, the economy has added nearly 16 million jobs, while the unemployment rate fell to half-century lows. Some of those job gains reflect a bounce-back from the pandemic, but the U.S. now has 6.4 million more jobs than it did before COVID-19.  Even so, Friday’s report from the U.S. Labor Department is raising recession fears again. The Dow Jones average tumbled more than 600 points, or 1.5%, Friday and the broader S Markets likely panicked in part because when the unemployment ticked up to 4.3% last month — the highest since October 2021 — it set off the so-called Sahm Rule. Named for former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, the rule holds that a recession is almost always underway already if the three-month average unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. It’s been triggered in every U.S. recession since 1970.  But Sahm herself doubts that a recession is “imminent.’’ Speaking before the numbers came out Friday, she said: “If the Sahm Rule were to trigger, it would join the ever-growing group of indicators, rules of thumb, that weren’t up to the task.’’ Other previously trustworthy recession indicators that have flopped in the post-pandemic era include: — A bond market measure with a dry-as-dust label: The “inverted yield curve.’’ — The rule of thumb that two consecutive quarters of falling economic output amounts to a “technical recession.’’ On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he is aware of the Sahm Rule and its implications, but noted that other recession signals, such as changes in bond yields, haven’t been borne out in recent years. “This pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted,” Powell said at a news conference. “Many received pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s because the situation really is unusual or unique.”  Powell spoke after Fed officials kept their key interest rate unchanged but signaled that they could reduce the rate as soon as their next meeting in September. Powell also downplayed the impact of the Sahm Rule, calling it a “statistical regularity.” “It’s not like an economic rule where it’s telling you something must happen,” he said.  For four years, economists have struggled to make sense of an economy that was first shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, then roared back with such strength that it revived inflationary pressures that had lain dormant for four decades. When the Federal Reserve moved to tame price increases by aggressively raising interest rates starting in March 2022, economists almost uniformly predicted that the higher borrowing costs would cause a recession.  Post-pandemic trends in the American jobs market may have at least temporarily sapped the Sahm Rule of its potency.  Unemployment has been rising steadily not so much because companies are slashing jobs but because so many people have poured into the job market. Not all of them have found work right away. The new arrivals have been  The inverted yield curve, meanwhile, is also seen as a recession signal because of the expectation that a recession occurs when the Fed rapidly boosts its benchmark interest rate, which it raised 11 times in 2022 and 2023. An  Typically, longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate investors for locking up their money for an extended period of time. When shorter-term bonds start paying out higher yields instead, it usually occurs because markets expect the Fed to crank up its short-term rate to quell inflation or cool the economy. Such steps often lead to a recession.  An inverted yield curve has preceded each of the last 10 recessions, according to Deutsche Bank, usually by about one to two years. It did provide one false signal in 1967, when an inversion occurred but no downturn followed. Why hasn’t it been right, so far, this time?  David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says that historically the yield curve inverts in part because longer-term yields fall on the expectation that the Fed will cut rates once the economy falls into recession. Yet investors have been expecting the Fed to cut rates because inflation is falling, Kelly said, not in anticipation of a downturn. “The perception of why the Federal Reserve might cut short rates right now is quite different to the past, and that’s why the yield curve is not nearly as ominous as it has been in previous episodes,” Kelly said. And Tiffany Wilding, an economist and managing director at bond giant PIMCO, says the government's huge financial assistance packages, totaling roughly $5 trillion in 2020 and 2021, enriched consumers and business alike. As a result, they have been able to spend and invest without borrowing as much, muting the impact of the Fed's rate hikes and dulling the signal from the inverted yield curve. Also in 2022, the government reported that gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — had fallen for two straight quarters, a long-time rule of thumb that has nearly always accompanied a recession. Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the U.S. economy  True, the top-line economic numbers showed that output was falling. But another measure in the GDP report told a different story: Stripping out volatile items such as inventories, government spending and imports, it showed that the underlying economy continued to expand at a healthy pace.  Economists are concerned that last month's rise in the jobless rate could portend a broader slowdown. Yet consumers, particularly higher-income ones, are still  “It doesn’t seem to me like the U.S. economy has fallen out of bed,” said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price's fixed income division. ""I’m still not in the camp that the U.S. economy is headed for a hard landing.” ___  Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.  "
New York politician convicted of corruption to be stripped of pension in first use of forfeiture law,A New York official says a village's former clerk will be the first politician to forfeit their pension under a state anti-corruption law after she stole over $1 million,The Associated Press,"ADDISON, N.Y. --  Ursula Stone pleaded guilty in May to a corruption charge for stealing from the Village of Addison over nearly two decades, said New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli. The former clerk-treasurer of the small village in the southwestern part of the state will be sentenced to up to nine years in prison and ordered to pay $1.1 million in restitution, DiNapoli office said in a news release.  New York in 2011 passed a law allowing judges to revoke or reduce pensions of crooked officials, but it didn’t apply to sitting lawmakers. Then in 2017, voters approved a ballot measure to close that loophole, allowing the state to go after the pensions of lawmakers no matter when they were elected.  DiNapoli said Stone's case is the first time the punishment is being used in New York. Prosecutors have to pursue the pension forfeiture penalty and prove a person knowingly committed a crime related to public office. “This case should send a clear message that those who dishonor their public office will face serious consequences,” DiNapoli said.  Stone, 56, ran the village's financial operations with no oversight and stole dozens of checks intended for the village, authorities said. She also gave herself unauthorized pay raises and wrote herself checks for unauthorized health insurance buyouts from the village.  She pleaded guilty in late May and agreed to forfeit her monthly pension payment of about $2,000.  A lawyer representing Stone did not immediately return a message left with his office.  "
"Nvidia is facing an antitrust probe from US regulators amid competitor complaints, report says",Antitrust tensions are heating up in the chipmaking industry,The Associated Press,"NEW YORK --  According to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors. The Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints. The Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday.  But a statement from Nvidia said the company “wins on merit” — and competes “based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws."" Without directly acknowledging details of The Information’s Thursday report, the company added that it is “happy to provide any information regulators need.” Nvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups — including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project — penned a  “Nvidia is the world’s chip gatekeeper,” the groups wrote, arguing the company had “bullied its way into a prominent investment position” by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. “Such a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.” Nvidia’s has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom — and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world.

"Canada completes negotiations to use US space launch technology, expertise and data","The Canadian government says it has completed negotiations with the United States on an agreement that would allow the use of U.S. space launch technology, expertise and data for space launches in Canada",The Associated Press,"OTTAWA, Ontario --  The agreement, which is yet to be signed, will establish the legal and technical safeguards needed, while ensuring the proper handling of sensitive technology, the government said in a news release. “Canada’s vibrant and growing commercial space launch industry relies on its ability to collaborate across borders,” said Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly in a statement. “The conclusion of negotiations between Canada and the United States means that we are one step closer to finalizing this agreement, which, when in force, will position our country to be a global leader in commercial space launch.” Maritime Launch Services, the company developing Canada’s first commercial spaceport in northeastern Nova Scotia, called the agreement a major step forward for the industry. “We look forward to welcoming our American clients to Nova Scotia in the coming months as we prepare for Canada’s first orbital launch from Spaceport Nova Scotia in 2026,” said president and CEO Stephen Matier. The federal government is in the process of modernizing its regulatory framework around commercial space launch activities as the industry sees tremendous growth globally, the release said. Ottawa has said it hopes to position Canada as future leader in commercial space launches. The country has geographical advantages, including a vast, sparsely populated territory, and high-inclination orbits. "
UAW leader says Trump would send the labor movement into reverse if he's elected again,The head of the United Auto Workers union says putting Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket increases the Democrats’ chance of winning Michigan and keeping the White House in November,TOM KRISHER AP auto writer,"DETROIT --  In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Shawn Fain said former President Donald Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse if he's elected again. “Trump has never supported working class people. He has never supported unions,"" Fain said. ""But he sure as hell was trying to pander for our votes now.” Fain has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against him at rallies and in speeches. Trump has called him an idiot, courting autoworkers' votes by saying Fain is putting their jobs at risk by embracing a move to electric vehicles. Although the UAW has members across the nation, many auto-making jobs are concentrated in the Great Lakers region and Michigan,  Trump and Harris realize that increasing their share of union votes gives them a much better chance of taking Michigan, where the last two presidential elections have been close, said Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton, and then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to President Joe Biden. Appealing to autoworkers helps to get votes from other union members, and union membership is high in the state at about 556,000, Masters said. That doesn't include thousands of family members and union retirees, he said. Any swing in those votes would be consequential in the race. During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, Trump  “You probably have to get rid of this fool, this stupid idiot representing the United Auto Workers,” Trump said at a July 20 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Trump claimed that he'll get 95% of the UAW vote because Fain is pushing electric vehicles. “They’re going to be made in China,” he said. He also pledged to bring the auto industry back from obliteration if he’s elected. But the industry is far from obliteration. Since Biden took office in January 2021, employment making cars and parts has grown 13.8% to just over 1 million people, according to the Labor Department. Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have made billions in annual profits. Fain dismissed the insults as typical Trump behavior. “All the man does his name call, label people. He never has solutions,” Fain said. “That’s the problem in leadership. You need to find solutions.” The move from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by electricity is inevitable, Fain said, and union members need to be ready for it. During the transition, auto companies are still making gasoline vehicles and keeping factory workers employed, he said. Trump, he said, did nothing for autoworkers when General Motors closed its small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019. Biden, who last month announced he would drop out of the race and support Harris,  On Friday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Harris has  Fain said he's confident that Harris will remain an advocate for working people, citing her trip to walk picket lines with striking GM workers in 2019. “She was there with the president through a lot of things we've been through,” he said. “She's been there for labor.” Of candidates to become Harris' vice presidential choice, the union prefers Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Fain said.  The union isn't backing Arizona Senator Mark Kelly because he has opposed a bill that would boost union organizing, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro favors school vouchers, which would take send tax dollars to private schools and hurt public schools, Fain said.  But even if Harris doesn't pick one of the union's favorites, the 370,000-member UAW would still put its political might behind her, Fain said. “I think she’s a brilliant woman. A very strong person,"" Fain said. “She understands the issues. I think Trump's just all talk. That's all he's ever been. He's a showman."" In a statement, Trump's campaign called Fain “a puppet for the Democrat party"" who isn't serving union laborers who are supporting Trump. “Shawn Fain’s empty words don’t matter — President Trump will take action to fight for the American auto worker,” the statement said. ____ Associated Press Writer Mike Householder contributed to this report.
